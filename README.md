# 👋 Hi there, I’m Nick Devops !

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about orchestration and automation in the cloud tech world. Here's a bit more about me:

## 👀 Interests
- **Cloud Orchestration**: Leveraging tools like Kubernetes and Docker Swarm to manage and scale containerized applications efficiently.
- **DevOps**: Implementing CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins, GitLab CI, and GitHub Actions to streamline software development and deployment processes.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Utilizing Terraform and Ansible to automate infrastructure provisioning and management.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Designing and deploying scalable, resilient, and maintainable microservices-based systems.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
- **Kubernetes Advanced Features**: Diving deeper into Kubernetes' ecosystem, including Helm for package management and Istio for service mesh.
- **Serverless Architectures**: Exploring AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions for building scalable serverless applications.
- **Observability and Monitoring**: Enhancing my skills with Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack to ensure the health and performance of applications.

## 💞️ Collaboration
I'm always looking to collaborate on innovative and impactful projects. Here are some areas I’m particularly interested in:
- **Cloud Native Projects**: From container orchestration to serverless applications, I enjoy the full lifecycle of cloud-native projects.
- **DevOps Automation**: Building and optimizing CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure automation, and configuration management.
- **Microservices Development**: Developing and deploying microservices with a focus on scalability, reliability, and performance.
